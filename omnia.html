<div>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <h5>Introduction</h5>
      <p>Gym life should be smooth. And, yet, gym software - a cornerstone to its business - can cause unwanted hiccups along the way.</p>
      <p>Why don’t athletes feel inclined to sign themselves into class? Why do they prefer to look at the workout on a website instead of the convenient mobile app? Why are coaches spending more time inputting a workout than being in the field? The answer to those questions lies in a product that streamlines all the essentials to bridge the gap of convenience and efficiency.</p>
      <p>It boils down to a simple notion of time allocation: coaches coach and athletes...athlete (read: train, workout, etc.).</p>   
    </div>
    <!-- The Competition -->
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <h5>Learning from the Competition</h5>
      <p>Conducting a competitive analysis helped with a better understanding of how this idea could grow while learning from others’ pitfalls and successes.</p>
      <h6>Wodify</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Wodify functions as an all-in-one. Attendance, performance data, point of sale, workout creation, kiosk functions, payroll, communication, documentation and more. It aims to be the sole, functioning software a gym would ever need. While it may have the largest clients, it is often described as “clunky,” “slow,” and “inefficient.”</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Beyond The Whiteboard</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>BTW specializes in logging the workouts and then creating data reports to analyze athletic performance. It encourages social activity and quantifies fitness levels. It can be seen as half of a puzzle - a part the focuses more on the training and coaching side of a business.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>MindBody</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>MindBody handles the financials - membership, inventory, payments, and the like. In many ways, it is used to complement Beyond The Whiteboard since it is more “behind-the-scenes” and business oriented.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- User Research -->
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <h5>User Research</h5>
      <p>While it is helpful that I have experience as both a coach and athlete, I focused my in-person interviews on those two main groups.</p>
      <p>Major takeaways from the separate interviews include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coach</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Would like to easily edit workouts, even if prior classes have already taken place in the day (this involves mobile)</li>
            <li>Naming conventions of the workouts can be improved</li>
            <li>Enjoys being able to see what movements have been recently programmed, preview mode also a nice feature</li>
            <li>Mobile functions could use improvement</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Athlete</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Would like an easier way to sign in</li>
            <li>Easier way to look up past performances, not have to calculate percentages</li>
            <li>Logging workouts a hassle, many don't do it - even if the scores are written on the board</li>
            <li>An incentive to workout</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- User Flow -->
    <h5>User Flow</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>From those interviews, I was able to designate a flow of how the app would operate, which would aid in  designing the crucial screens for this showcase. Focusing on the main functionalities also allowed for consistent references.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Mindmaps -->
    <h5>The Beginning of Design</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>Beginning the visual process meant branching out from one word - an activity most everyone does inside the gym: workout.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Branding -->
    <h5>The Brand</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>Omnia. A word that has stuck with me for a while. Well, actually, the phrase "carpe omnia" sticks - because why seize the day when you can have EVERYTHING? The “O” represents inclusiveness with a goal to reach all various forms of exercise.</p>
      <p>OMNIA utilized a mostly blue scheme with orange highlights to contrast the dark, uninviting combo of red and black.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Revision Station -->
    <h5>Revision, Revision, Revision</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>As the first project in my unfamiliar understanding of design, OMNIA underwent several revisions. From the initial wireframes to finished product, the difference became night and day.</p>
      <p>Questions were answered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do we effectively create a workout?</li>
        <li>How should we present an athlete’s information and accomplishments?</li>
        <li>Or even how to notify an athlete to sign-in?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- Final MockUps -->
    <h5>Final Mockups</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>While the focus was a singular page for a product showcase, the screens held a large importance, along with their placement. Other vital parts to the showcase - informational videos and partnered gyms - were also implemented with the final layout.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- All Together Now -->
    <h5>Putting It All Together</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>OMNIA culminates in a page showcasing a highly mobile-friendly app that simplifies multiple facets of the gym process.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Reflection -->
    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>As with every project, there are victories to be celebrated and lessons to be learned from.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan First, Create Later</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I spent a lot of time jumping from point to point without a clear direction. It may have been nearly expected as a n00b, but it put a ton of hinderance the flow of the project.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Talk to People With Preparation, But Be Open to Organic Convo</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Speaking with coaches and athletes that I’m familiar with seemed a little “stiff” and overly “formal” at first, especially since I wanted to stick to a certain process. However, it’s important that - while it is best to stay on track - there were other underlying issues uncovered only through organic conversation.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Ask Lots of Questions</li>
          <ul>
            <li>But just enough that I don’t get completely derailed. By asking more questions, it was easier to identify the problem and create a hierarchy of what needed to be done first.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Stay the Course</li>
          <ul>
            <li>While initially frustrated, confused, and overwhelmed (how it is with most new things in my life), it was vital that I take the feedback and grow from it. Being able to know why a decision was made and to defend said decision became a backbone that would carry into other projects.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
