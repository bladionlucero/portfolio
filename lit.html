    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <h5>Introduction</h5>
      <p>To shy away from the physical activities (gym) and dive into witty intellectual, alliteration blossomed from a love of wordplay and fairly minimalistic branding of my favorite products. It presented a challenge to not only emulate successful shops, but to improve upon the infrastructure.</p>  
    </div>
    <!-- The Competition -->
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <h5>The Other Guys aka the Competition</h5>
      <h6>Huckberry</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>We start with outside before delving deeper...meaning, I looked at a company that specialized in the recent boom of urban dwellers seeking the outdoors.</li>
        <li>They exemplify a company that started from the bottom with basically no experience and executed in such a way that filled a hole in their niche market. Products are featured in tile format, some of it is bundled together depending on the occasion or need. Huckberry exudes the same attitude they bring into company into their products & site - which would have to be the ultimate goal of alliteration with minimal detraction.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Stussy</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Ah, yes, the brand that started it all in my teenage years. I wanted to take a closer look at them and their offerings - not only for the target age demographic but to understand how they get people to come back from their product.</li>
        <li>Their brand and logo are very prevalent in their products. However, in analyzing their online experience, they shine by placing each item with just enough essential information that doesn’t tire the eye. They make quick, useful interpretations of the hover function with all of their products.</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>AerSF</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>AerSF represents the really niche group. A company that focuses on the daily urban worker who is on the go and needs a sleek and convenient way to carry work + workout.</li>
        <li>As a still small company, their offerings are restricted to two colors. However, their product provides innovations to EDC (every day carry) in such a minimalist manner that eliminates the unneeded bulk of life. In showcasing their product, they focuses on lots of pictures in various scenarios. This focus helps the buyer understand sizing references. They also include reviews and other technical specs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When bringing together alliteration, it’s necessary to focus on what these companies apply to their certain circumstance. In some cases, it was exponentially easier to navigate around to find a certain product. However, having an exorbitant amount of options isn’t terrible - unless it interferes with other processes. By looking at all three companies, alliteration took form.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- User Research -->
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <h5>User Research</h5>
      <p>In an effort to understand the influence of shopping online, I sent out a survey that covered basics such as: how often they shop, mobile vs. desktop, linking payment accounts or social accounts, why they purchase a product online, and short examples of horrible shopping experiences.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- User Flow -->
    <h5>User Flow</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>When understanding the competitors and my sample surveyors, I created the flow of functionality for this desktop based experience to operate. This became crucial in replicating a no-hassle shopping experience. And so, the flow would be referenced back numerous times to keep track with the goal.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Mindmaps -->
    <h5>The Beginning of Design</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>Sometimes, one word is all it takes. But, really, alliteration came from a vague starter of “18-25 y/o.”</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Branding -->
    <h5>The Brand</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>Alliteration came about from a love of wordplay, current vernacular, and potential witty depth. “Lit” is conveniently a part of “alliteration.” Therefore...it’s al(LIT)eration, fam.</p>
      <p>Colors became challenging - I wanted it to pop...almost 80’s esque but in a modern setting. In my research, most places were going for dulled colors, monochromatic coloring. I looked for a triad and settled upon the following.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Revision Station -->
    <h5>Constant Revision and Evolution</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>Of course, playing with the word lit in alliteration became a challenge. My initial color schemes really focused on the wrong parts of the word - to my humor and chagrin.</p>
      <p>Filter bars, quick views to hover states, and the like. Everything received major revisions from the first. And, yet, evolution is such a site to see. Literally, site and sight. See? Wordplay.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Final MockUps -->
    <h5>Final Mockups</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>After collaboration and a broader understanding of the principles, it was time to unleash a usability test.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- All Together Now -->
    <h5>Putting It Out There (Usability Tests)</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>Positives: Nearly all easy ratings...only one section was rated a 3 (which still translates to easy/intermediate in a scale of 1-10), the design was user friendly for my entire crowd of 6 (age ranged from 22 all the way to 53)</p>
      <p>Negatives: Wording needs adjustment on script, same with formatting...a lot of people didn’t realize there was more than one page, the transitions felt jumpy through invision (doubtful much can be done with this through invision, confusion of going from hover state to a filter)</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Reflection -->
    <h5>Reflection</h5>
    <div class="case-study-title">
      <p>A necessary step to grow from the successes and pitfalls.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hammer Down the Basics</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There were certain design mistakes that could’ve been avoided sooner - saving lots of time. When dealing with time-sensitive material, it’s easier with the basics as - not only a guide but - a reminder of what not to do.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Know Your Data</li>
          <ul>
            <li>While it is imperative to understand why I'm asking the questions, it’s also important that I know what it’s showing me. People - complete strangers from around the world - took time out of their day to answer my questions. And, yet, we shared common shopping experiences that wouldn’t have been understood without diving into the data.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Maybe Creating Shirts Isn’t What I Should Be Doing</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If I could go back before trying to put a usability test, I would’ve taken more care into the shirt offerings. Granted, I still feel like I’m the least artistic person out there...I did enjoy the design and functionality of the site once the more “aesthetic” portions were out of the way.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Who Knew Having A Solid Map Helped? Everyone. Everyone did.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Unlike the first project where I jumped all over the place, I followed the process to a near “T.” By doing this, it helped tremendously with keeping on track and focusing on the areas that needed prioritizing.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
